          <h1>GATE 0NE</h1>

          <p>My starting point for this project was the concept of mitigating the effects of climate change through planting.
<br><br>
            I had three design intents:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A way to help urban renters plant and garden</li>
                <li>A more efficient tree planting tool to expand carbon capture capacity</li>
                <li>A way to increase public consensus on the need for climate action</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              My secondary research was broad in scope, with topics like Climate Change, Tree Planting for Forestry, Silviculture, Agroforestry, Guerrilla Gardening, as well as a wide range of existing design solutions.
              <br><br>
              My primary research was limited to a facebook poll, the results of which are below

    <p>Fang Planting System <br><br> The Fang Planting System is a forestry solution that replaces plastic greenhouse trays with biodgradeable ones whose individual cones are then driven into the ground with the planter.  This would reduce plastic waste and prevent J-root while also being efficient.  The cone is dropped into the shaft, held in place by pins that then drive it into the ground when the mechanism is depressed.</p>

            <br><br> Following this workshop and continued secondary research I abandoned the Forestry Industry angle and turned my attention towards using the military.

    My research for this gate pivoted to the concept of risk.  I dove into the subject of insurance, climate change impact, and the costs associated with it.  For the purpose of raising awareness I chose to focus on learning what I would need to develop the climate app.  It was overwhelming.  Applying Global Climate Models to an AR app was far outside my capabilities and timeframe.

      <h2>Autonomous Pollination Drone Stations</h2>
      <p>
        Eijiro Miyako, from the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology has been working on drone pollination since 2017.
        My drones are based on his idea of using drones with hairs coated in ionic gel that pick up and release pollen from flower to
        flower.  His work is the proof of concept I am relying on.  While his drones are remote controlled, I propose the development
        of AI that identifies flowering of a number of species, pilots drones,  and retains mapping data that tags pollinated plants for
        seed collection during the appropriate season by trained C.D.F. personnel.

      <h2>Seed “Bullets”</h2>
      <p> Following the harvest seeds will be transported to a nearby facility to be processed into
        seed pods.  These seed pods would be made from a waste paper shell, infused with chilli powder
        to deter pests, and filled with seed, soil and fertilizer to boost early development.
        The following spring personnel will be deployed in groups to remote locations a few kilometers
         North of the treeline with a quantity of seed pods and spend a few months planting.
         <br><br>
        Planting seedlings would likely produce higher yields, but create challenges.  The energy required to
        grow them in a nursery would be substantial.  Transporting the seedlings and keeping them wet and alive
        requires labour and resources.  Seed pods, by comparison, are lower maintenance and require less energy to produce.
        When we consider that my proposal recommends polyculture, the challenge of using seedlings only grows.
        Each species has is own requirements, making coordination difficult.
       <br><br>
      Seed pods are definitely the way to go.

            <p>

             The seed pods will be planted using a simple tool.  A basic handle and shaft that can be depressed
             to drive the seed pod to the appropriate depth.  A spring then returns the shaft, loading another round from a
             tube that leads to a large backpack full of these round pods.  This chambered round is held in place in the barrel
             by small points that score the sides of the pods as they are driven past.  These scorings create weak points for
             the plants to break through as the pod biodegrades.  This tool is designed to be durable and easy to repair with
             minimal parts.
