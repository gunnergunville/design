        </div>

          <p>Climate change poses the greatest existential risk our species has faced.  Temperatures
            are rising in the Arctic at a greater pace than elsewhere.  As the permafrost melts thousands
            of years worth of organic matter will begin to decay, releasing large quantities of methane,
            a greenhouse gas, compounding the effects of our own carbon emissions.  This feedback loop
            could prove disastrous for life as we know it.
          <br><br>
           Tree planting is touted by scientists as a way to mitigate climate change through the creation of
           carbon sinks.  This is not a substitute for reducing global emmisions, but a complementary initiative.
           I propose enlisting the military to facilitate an afforestry effort North of the treeline.
          <br><br>
          I propose the development of autonomous pollination drone stations along the current treeline to
           maximise seed yields of the local flora.  Seeds will then be harvested by personnel, and prepped
           for planting the following spring.  Planting expeditions will create polyculture forest islands
           North of the treeline over thawing permafrost.  These groves will speed up the spread of forests
           in the North.  These forests can help slow the permafrost thaw by creating shade that lowers the
           surface temperature.  The flora will also absorb the excess water, trapped on the surface by
           permafrost, which will dry the soil, making it a better insulator, further preserving the permafrost.
           As these forests mature and spread they will become valuable carbon sinks.

          <h1>Canadian Armed Forces To the Rescue</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          <p>
    <br><br>The Canadian Armed Forces are tasked with our National Defense.  Climate Change poses a threat to not
    just our own nation, but to the world.  While our historical national threats have been human, none have posed
    the threat to our well being as much as the challenge we now face.
    We must confront this threat with as great a resolve as we have in wars past.
    <br><br>
    The time to defend ourselves is now, and the C.A.F. possesses the systemic capabilities to start fighting back immediately.
    This effort will require the military’s remote fast deployment, logistics, equipment, training and organizational capabilities,
    augmented by new technologies and guided by earth sciences.  I propose a new branch of the military; The Climate Defense Force, or C.D.F.
    <br><br>
    For those concerned that this initiative will distract from our military’s traditional defense capabilities I have some arguments that I believe should alleviate those concerns.  First and foremost, the C.A.F. is already eager to increase our operational capacity in the North.  The afforestry effort will require infrastructure that could easily have mixed uses.  Additionally the enlistment of additional personnel will create a greater pool of people with familiarity of military culture, operations, and outdoor survival skills who could be an asset in the unlikely event of an invasion of hostile forces.  Moreover, the practical experience gained through the implementation of this initiative from rapid deployment to supply chain operations and maintenance would be invaluable.

      <h2>Autonomous Pollination Drone Stations</h2>
      <p> Eijiro Miyako, from the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology has been working on drone pollination since 2017.  My drones are based on his idea of using drones with hairs coated in ionic gel that pick up and release pollen from flower to flower.  His work is the proof of concept I am relying on.  While his drones are remote controlled, I propose the development of AI that identifies flowering of a number of species, pilots drones,  and retains mapping data that tags pollinated plants for seed collection during the appropriate season by trained C.D.F. personnel.</p>

      <h2>Seed “Bullets”</h2>
      <p> Following the harvest seeds will be transported to a nearby facility to be processed into
        seed pods.  These seed pods would be made from a waste paper shell, infused with chilli powder
        to deter pests, and filled with seed, soil and fertilizer to boost early development.
        The following spring personnel will be deployed in groups to remote locations a few kilometers
         North of the treeline with a quantity of seed pods and spend a few months planting seeds.
         <br><br>
Planting seedlings would likely produce higher yields, but create challenges.  The energy required to
grow them in a nursery would be substantial.  Transporting the seedlings and keeping them wet and alive
 requires labour.  Seed pods, by comparison, are lower maintenance and require less energy to produce.
 When we consider that my proposal recommends polyculture, the challenge of using seedlings only grows.
  Each species has is own requirements, making coordination difficult.
  Seed pods are definitely the way to go.
